Certainly! Here's a basic outline of how you can create an AI agent to play Mario using the OpenAI Gym library and a neural network that can adapt using reinforcement learning with Q-learning algorithm:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
You'll need to install a few Python libraries including OpenAI Gym, NumPy, and TensorFlow (or any other deep learning framework of your choice).

```python
!pip install gym numpy tensorflow
```
### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
```
### Step 3: Define the Q-Network

```python
class QNetwork:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.model = Sequential()
        self.model.add(Dense(24, input_dim=state_size, activation='relu'))
        self.model.add(Dense(24, activation='relu'))
        self.model.add(Dense(action_size, activation='linear'))
        self.model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001))
```
### Step 4: Define the Agent

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.q_network = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)

    def get_action(self, state):
        q_values = self.q_network.model.predict(state)
        return np.argmax(q_values[0])

    def train(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        target = reward
        if not done:
            target = reward + 0.99 * np.amax(self.q_network.model.predict(next_state)[0])
        q_values = self.q_network.model.predict(state)
        q_values[0][action] = target
        self.q_network.model.fit(state, q_values, epochs=1, verbose=0)
```

### Step 5: Initialize the Gym Environment and Agent

```python
env = gym.make('MarioGame-v0')
state_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]
action_size = env.action_space.n
agent = Agent(state_size, action_size)
```

### Step 6: Train the Agent

```python
num_episodes = 1000
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    state = np.reshape(state, [1, state_size])
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = agent.get_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        next_state = np.reshape(next_state, [1, state_size])
        agent.train(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state
    print("Episode: {}/{} - Score: {}".format(episode + 1, num_episodes, reward))
```

### Step 7: Use the Trained Agent to Play Mario

```python
state = env.reset()
state = np.reshape(state, [1, state_size])
done = False
while not done:
    action = agent.get_action(state)
    next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    state = np.reshape(next_state, [1, state_size])
    env.render()
```

Please note that this is a basic implementation and may require further optimization and customization depending on your specific use case. Additionally, you may need to modify the code to suit the specific environment and neural network architecture you want to use.
